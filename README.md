Rock-Paper-Scissors Game in Python

This Python program allows the user to play a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The player selects one of the three options—rock, paper, or scissors—while the computer randomly chooses its move. The game then compares the two choices and determines the winner based on the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The program provides immediate feedback on the result, declaring whether the player wins, loses, or if the game ends in a tie.
